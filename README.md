# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Author Notes
- Only really tested the business logic as it's the most complicated
- No design was given, so only basic styling was done
- Basic validation on the input box, could be expanded
- There's a weird sorting bug when going from different type of sort (task -> priority and vice versa)
